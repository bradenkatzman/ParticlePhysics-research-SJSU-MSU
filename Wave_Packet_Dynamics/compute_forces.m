function [force, potential_energy, kinetic_enery] = forces(num_particles, num_dimensions,...
    positions, velocities, mass)
    

    % WAIT ON FILLING THIS OUT UNTIL AFTER TALKING WITH LS ABOUT THE FINAL
    % FORM TO USE FOR THE QUADRATIC WELL OPERATOR
    %   - also likely want to modularize this to take different potential
    %   functions so we can probably add that as a parameter
