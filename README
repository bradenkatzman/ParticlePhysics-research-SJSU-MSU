Wave Packet Dynamics

The Schrodinger equation is computationally intensive to solve, motivating a need to use accurate approximations and representations. The Wave Packet equation is one such representation. In this project, we explore the solution space of a numerical method for solving the wave packet equation, given by a Gaussian function. The parameters of the equations are represented by the follow system of differential equations:

dqdt = (1/mass) * p
dpdt = -1 * gradient(q) * V
dGammadt = (1/mass) * eta
dEtadt = 9 * reduced_planck_constant^2 * (1/9 * mass^2 * gamma^3) - partialVpartialGamma

Where V is an arbitrary potential function

We solve these equations using the Velocity Verlet algorithm
1. Calculate x(t + delta_t) = x(t) + v(t) * delta_t + (1/2) * a(t) * delta_t^2
2. Derive a(t + delta_t) from the interaction potential using x(t + delta_t)
3. Calcualte v(t + delta_t) = v(t) + (1/2) * (a(t) + a(t + delta_t)) * delta_t
